		<h4>Help</h4>
		<p>
		Trace Digital Services provides help with various issues, but in some cases we are forced to charge a small "technical support" fee since nearly all the issues we have been tasked with could have been solved with the help of <a href="www.google.co.za">Google</a>. Therefore, Trace Digital Services reserves the right to charge a nominal technical support fee, calculated on an hourly basis, for the duration of the support session. Please be advised that the most common problems will be outlined on the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> so please check there first before consulting us for help.

		<h4>EPUBS</h4>
		<p>
		Ebook help rates are amongst the highest, since we receive such a sheer volume of requests relating to third party tools and frequently have to provide technical support for third party products. Trace Digital Services has therefore decided to charge a reasonable fee for assistance with EPUB books, since the internet is flooded with frequent solutions and workarounds for EPUB-related issues on all operating systems. If you need to ask for help, then please make sure that a quick <a href="www.google.co.za">Google</a> has not solved your problem.

		<h4>MOBI</h4>
		<p>
		Mobis support rates are not that intimidating since the MOBI format is not well supported on all platforms, so we encourage users to try to get help from us whenever they are stuck. Obviously, the same <a href="www.google.co.za">Google</a> rules apply - consult with Google, if they cannot answer your question, then we will be glad to help you.

		<h4>Drawings</h4>
		<p>
		We provide help with Drawings at almost no cost since we receive almost no help requests for drawings - it seems that even the least tech-savvy of people have no problems opening a drawing file.

		<h4>Websites</h4>
		<p>
		Trace Digital Services provides the most help with websites, since owning a website is hard... we do, however, charge a "support and maintenance" fee, since ownership of a website requires some level of competency with the technologies your websites use. If you don't care much for learning about web technologies, then you can have Trace Digital Services support your website 24/7 by signing a "Service Contract" with TDS - we forgo the "Spot" maintenance fee for a subsidised standby fee which ensures that you have the greatest level of support.<br/>
		
Please note that for changes and redesigns, website owners will be billed above the support fee, at standard modification and design rates.
