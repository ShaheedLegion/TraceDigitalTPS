		<h4>About the company</h4>
		<p>
		n 2010 Trace Digital Services found a gap in the market for electronic books in South African Publishing. So we offered our customers a channel to publish for the future. We started converting all their printed material into electronic formats for Android and Ipad Tablets, Mobi, PC and MAC. These books can be read on all formats and are distributed through On the Dot, Kalahari and Amazon.<br/>

		Typesetting being our core business we are able to layout and design books ready for print or electronic formats. We do all subject areas from Mathematics, Science, Literature and Accounting. <br/>

		We specialise mainly in Academic Publishing, Law Publishing, Trade Publishing and submissions for Schools Education markets.<br/>

		We service all major publishers in South Africa and some smaller publishers.
